<h1>Honey Ants</h1>
<p>This is a simulation of a colony of ants and their quest to find honey. Honey Ant's don't possess the same impressive
    intelligence of most ant species, but they still manage to function as perfectly adequate ants and have somehow survived extinction.
    When the ant world is first loaded 3 drops of honey are randomly generated around the map. Selecting a different food amount and restarting the game, will generate a new
ant world with the selected number of random honey drops randomly generated around the map. An in-depth explanation
of Honey Ant behavior is provided at the bottom of the page.<p>

<p><b>Foraging: </b>
    Ants exit the colony in a random direction and begin foraging for food, leaving a red pheromone trail as they search.
    Honey ants aren't very efficient while foraging and will sometimes walk along their old path. Their senses aren't that
    great and they can only find food in tiles that directly border their tile.
    While foraging, they prefer to move three tiles before picking a new random direction to explore. If moving three tiles
    will cause them to leave their world, they stop and pick a new direction to travel.
</p>
<p><b>Finding Food: </b>After finding food an ant will return home, cutting out any loops it may have taken in it's path.
    While returning the ant leaves a purple pheromone trail for other ants to follow. Once an ant returns home any residual red pheromone
    trails left by it will fade from the ant world. If an ant takes the last piece of honey at the food source it returns home
    without leaving a trail. If an ant that followed a purple pheromone trail takes the last piece of honey at the food source
    it will erase the trail that it followed on its route home.</p>

<p><b>Discovering Food Trail: </b> If an ant discovers a purple pheromone trail while foraging it will follow the trail until
    it reaches the food source or the trail ends. Because Honey Ants don't have great senses, they can only find purple trails
    if they happen to stumble directly on top of one. While returning with food, or from a dead end, the ant will follow the path of the purple trail
    until it reaches the point where it discovered it. The ant will then follow it's original red pheromone trail back to the nest,
    cutting out any loops. If an ant follows a purple trail to a dead end it will immediately give up on finding food and return home,
    abandoning its duties for the rest of the day. While returning home from a false trail, the Honey Ant erases it followed so no other ants
    succumb to the same fate.</p>
